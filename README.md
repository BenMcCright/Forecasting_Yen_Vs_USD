## Time Series Conclusions
### I would not buy the Yen right now, but would try to buy the Yen when its actual price is below the trend.
### The risk of the Yen is expected to increase.
### Both the ARMA and ARIMA model do not provide statistically significant insight due to their high p-levels, however the GARCH model has a low enough p-score that it is statistically significant.

## Regression Analysis Conclusions
### The In-Sample predictions and Out-of-Sample predictions are very close to one another, but the In-Sample predictions are slightly more accurate.

## Mean Squared Error (MSE)
### - In-Sample = 0.0263
### - Out-of-Sample = 0.0287

## Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
### - In-Sample = 0.1622
### - Out-of-Sample = 0.1693
